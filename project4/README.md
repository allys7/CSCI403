1. Ally Smith, I didn't collaborate with anyone.

2. Some of the more advanced queries gave me some trouble, but breaking them
   into smaller sections made it easier.

3. I liked that the expected number of rows in the result was provided.

4. I worked on this project in 2 sittings and probably spent a bit under 2
   hours in total.
